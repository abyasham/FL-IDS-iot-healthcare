# IoT Healthcare Security Dataset

# Instructions: 

- This dataset contains the normal and malicious traffic of an IoT healthcare use case.

- We created a use case of an IoT-based ICU with the capacity of 2 beds, where each bed is equipped with nine patient monitoring devices (i.e., sensors) and one control unit called as Bedx-Control-Unit. All these devices were created using the IoT-Flock tool (available at: https://github.com/ThingzDefense/IoT-Flock )
